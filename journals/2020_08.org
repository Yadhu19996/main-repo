** Was reading about [[ted nelson]]  and his [[xanadu project]]
*** The work of a man and his team over decades is truly fascinating and inspiring
*** Even though he admits that they screwed up big time , still the passion and obsession towards their dream project is something
*** Today seeing softwares like [[roam]] and other [[tools for thought]] emerging  out as more accessible to the pubic , it feels like the resurrection of [[xanadu project]]
** [[Dilemma]]
*** I use [[roam]]  for all of my [[note making]] but recently felt that i should have a software close to roam which can provide a local storage for my notes
*** [[logseq]] is my final pic
**** [[Reasons]]
***** The developerâ€™s vision is nice, his dedication to the project is truly great
***** [[Athens research]] was a good option, but they went to the pricing/pay wall thing thought initially they had given out the impression that they would be free to use tool
** Idk why but some reason i see a part of myself in [[ted nelson]] . Maybe because my life is also devoid of* meaning*
